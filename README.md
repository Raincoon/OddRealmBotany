# OddRealmBotany

This project will deal with categorising grow times, biome occurrences, etc. of various crops (and trees) in the colony-building game Odd Realm. 
<br>
In the game, plants and trees may be sown and cultivated from seed and may also grow naturally depending on season and chosen biome. Some tree varieties may also yield fruit.
<br>
<sub>Tracking fruit<->tree relations specifically is not planned, as they are few and fairly obvious (apples from apple trees, coconuts from palm trees); similar functionality can be achieved with matching tags.</sub>
<br>
Current planned features<ul>
  <li>login with username+password for item tracking and/or admin functionality</li>
  <li>adding plants and tags (admin-only?)</li>
  <li>searching for botanical items based on attributes (grow time/season/biome/other tags?)</li>
</ul>
