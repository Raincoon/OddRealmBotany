This guide runs you through the basic functionality of the project. If you need to run the files locally or on your own Heroku instance, see the [install guide](./installguide.md) first.  

### Registration and logging in
There are links for both logging in and signing up in the navigation bar at the top of the page.  
For a new user, click the `Sign Up` link and pick a username and a password to your liking.  
If you already have an account, use the `Log In` link and provide your account credentials to log in.  

### Adding data
Once you have logged in, you may begin by adding a plant or a tag from the dropdown menu labeled `New`. You may add as many plants and/or tags as you like.  

### Other functionality
To edit or remove a plant, use the `Edit` or `Delete` buttons for their respective actions.  
If you wish to add a tag you have created to one of your plants, click the `Tag` button on the entry you wish to add a tag to; You will be provided a list of your tags, just select the one you want and click the `Add` button.  
Removing tags from a plant functions similarly: click `Remove a Tag` and select the tag you wish to remove.  

To view all plants with a certain tag, click on the tag's name and you will be redirected to that tag's page. This page also provides the links to `Edit` or `Delete` the specified tag.
