While the project is now "finished", there are still things I would like to add to it.  

- Making things look prettier (colours, spacing, that kind of stuff)
- Password changing
- Being able to list all tags a user has created (you currently need to tag a plant in order to edit/delete the tag, not that user friendly)
- Being able to order the plant list by column values
