While the project is now "finished", there are still many things I would like to do with it.  

- Making things look prettier (colours, spacing, that kind of stuff)
- Adding password changing
- Being able to list all tags a user has created (you currently need to tag a plant in order to edit/delete the tag, not that user friendly)
